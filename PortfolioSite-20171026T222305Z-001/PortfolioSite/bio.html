 I have worked all sorts of jobs building up to my decision to become a game designer and developer. I worked at my local YMCA as a day camp instructor. I worked with kids of all ages and enjoyed the great outdoors with them all while teaching the four coore values of the YMCA respect, responsibility, honesty, and caring. I did a lot of rock climbing and worked at the YMCA from ages 14-20. After that I spent a summer working at a high ropes courses teaching leadership through high ropes challenges and team building exercises.

<p> 
     After working at the ropes course, I took a job as a UW-Stout Technician. I worked to solve hardware and software problems across campus and created resources to resolve those issues. I was eventually promoted to the PC-Repair Manager. As the PC Repair Manager, I oversaw managing my own area of PC Repair. I would work with faculty and staff to resolve their hardware issues and train technicians how to solve their software issues. I worked with every department on campus and had to keep track of the machines during the repair process, and document anything we did to resolve the issue. Tasks included checking warranty, Contact HP for parts, shipping and receiving machines, setting up new machines, troubleshooting via the phone or in person, backing up and restoring data, training new and veteran employees, creating documentation for the employees to reference, working with full time staff, and continuing to work with the other managers as well as my course work. I was the only PC Repair manager, and I answered to the Student Technology Assistance Resources Director.

    <h1> Activision Quality Assurance </h1>
    <img src="Stronghold_Metadata_Image.jpg" alt="Call of Duty" style="width:264x;height 264pxs;">
    <p>
        After graduation, I began my career as a Activision Quality Assurance Tester.I worked on the Call of Duty WWII title.I worked 10-12 hour days for a little over 3 months reporting 298 issues. Each issue had a lengthy reporting process. The issue subjects included, but are not limited to, graphical corruption, broken or inconsistent AI, progression breaks, minor art issues, exploits, menu inconsistency, major crashes, losses of functionality, game balancing, ui visual, ui functionality, consistency with past titles, text, legal, and historical accuracy.I worked in Jira and the devtrack suite to track issues and continuously update the necessary elements for the devs. I chose to part ways with Activision as my contract concluded. My goal is to develop software. The quality assurance position was a great oppurtunity to learn about a triple a company, and get an inside view of the products as it approaches launch, but my ultimate goal is to continously improve my coding practices. I hope to apply my techncial skills in a fast paced professional environment and add many titles to my portfolio.
