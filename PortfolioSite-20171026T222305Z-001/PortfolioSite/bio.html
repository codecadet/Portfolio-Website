     To Whom it may concern,<br/>
Thank you so much for visiting my site and learning a bit about me.My name is Chase Soren Christensen. I was born in Edina Minnesota, went to Normandale French Immersion, received my high school diploma from Edina High School and graduated from the  University of Wisconsin Stout with a Bachelorâ€™s of Science for game design and development with a computer science concentration. I also earned an applied language minor for my fluency in french.

 I have worked all sorts of jobs building up to my decision to become a game design and developer. I worked at my local YMCA as a day camp instructor. I worked with kids of all ages and enjoyed the great outdoors with them all while teaching the four coore values of the YMCA respect, responsibility, honesty, and caring. I did a lot of rock climbing and worked at the YMCA from ages 14-20. After that I spent a summer working at a high ropes courses teaching leadership through high ropes challenges and team building games.

    After working at the ropes course, I took a job as a UW-Stout Technician. I worked to solve hardware and software problems across campus and created resources to resolve those issues. I was eventually promoted to the PC-Repair Manager. As the PC Repair Manager, I oversaw managing my own area of PC Repair. I would work with faculty and staff to resolve their hardware issues and train technicians how to solve their software issues. I worked with every department on campus and had to keep track of the machines during the repair process, and document anything we did to resolve the issue. Tasks included checking warranty, Contact HP for parts, shipping and receiving machines, setting up new machines, troubleshooting via the phone or in person, backing up and restoring data, training new and veteran employees, creating documentation for the employees to reference, working with full time staff, and continuing to work with the other managers as well as my course work. I was the only PC Repair manager, and I answered to the Student Technology Assistance Resources Director.

    During the summers of 2015 and 2016 I worked at ID Tech as an instructor and then a lead instructor. I worked with gamers of all ages and taught all sorts of game and programming related courses. The first summer I worked in Madison, WI and the 2nd summer I worked in Milwaukee, WI. I stayed over night in the dorms and made sure the younglings got to all their activities and left with a passion for Game Design.
